## Objective
Master `for` and `while` loops in Python.

## Key Concepts
- `for` loops with `range()`
- `while` loops
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`

## Reading
Chapter 7 of [*Think Python*](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf)

## Exercises
1. Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use a `while` loop to print numbers until the user enters `stop`.
3. Write a loop that prints even numbers from 1 to 20.
4. Explain what `break` and `continue` do in your own words.

## Challenge
Write a guessing game that asks the user to guess a secret number between 1 and 10.
- Give feedback (too high / too low)
- Use a `while` loop
